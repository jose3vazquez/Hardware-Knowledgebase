## **Hardware & Architecture Differences**

1. **Mac systems** primarily use Apple Silicon (M1, M2) or Intel x86 CPUs.

2. **PC systems** use a wider variety of Intel and AMD CPUs.

3. **Mac motherboards** are proprietary and non-user-upgradable.

4. **PC motherboards** follow standard ATX, microATX, and mini-ITX form factors.

5. **Mac RAM** is often soldered on the board, limiting upgrades.

6. **PC RAM** is typically user-replaceable via DIMM/SO-DIMM slots.

7. **Mac GPUs** in Apple Silicon are integrated into the CPU package.

8. **PC GPUs** can be upgraded via PCIe slots.

9. **Mac SSDs** may use proprietary connectors or soldered storage.

10. **PC storage** often uses standard SATA or NVMe drives.

## **Ports & Connectivity**

11. **Mac laptops** have shifted toward USB-C/Thunderbolt-only ports.

12. **PCs** maintain a mix of USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and DisplayPort.

13. **MagSafe connectors** provide magnetic charging for MacBooks.

14. **PC laptops** use a variety of barrel and USB-C charging ports.

15. **Macs** often include fewer ports, relying on adapters.

16. **PCs** may have more integrated ports for peripherals.

17. **Thunderbolt** is common on both Mac and high-end PC motherboards.

18. **AirPort cards** were Apple‚Äôs proprietary Wi-Fi modules (now replaced by standard Wi-Fi).

19. **Mac Ethernet adapters** are often USB-C or Thunderbolt-based.

20. **PCs** often have built-in RJ-45 ports.

## **Display & Graphics**

21. **Retina displays** on Macs have higher pixel density than many standard PC screens.

22. **PC displays** vary widely in resolution and refresh rate.

23. **Mac external displays** often use Thunderbolt or USB-C.

24. **PCs** support HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, and DVI.

25. **True Tone technology** adjusts Mac display color temperature.

26. **PCs** rely on OS or monitor controls for similar features.

27. **Macs** support limited eGPU options via Thunderbolt.

28. **PCs** have broader eGPU and internal GPU upgrade options.

29. **HDR support** is standard in newer Macs and PCs.

30. **Color calibration** tools are available on both platforms.

## **Input Devices**

31. **Magic Keyboard** and **Magic Mouse** are Apple-specific designs.

32. **PC keyboards and mice** come in a wider range of designs.

33. **Mac trackpads** support advanced multi-touch gestures.

34. **PC trackpads** vary in quality and gesture support.

35. **Touch Bar** was featured on some MacBook Pro models.

36. **PCs** may use customizable function keys instead.

37. **Apple keyboards** use Command and Option keys in place of Ctrl/Alt.

38. **PC keyboards** have Windows and Alt keys.

39. **Mac mice** support touch-sensitive surfaces.

40. **PC mice** often feature extra programmable buttons.

## **File Systems & Storage Compatibility**

41. **HFS+** and **APFS** are macOS file systems.

42. **NTFS** is the default for Windows.

43. **exFAT** is supported by both macOS and Windows for large file cross-compatibility.

44. **FAT32** is universally supported but limited to 4 GB file sizes.

45. **Macs** can read NTFS by default but need software to write to it.

46. **Windows** cannot read APFS without third-party tools.

47. **Network shares** via SMB allow file sharing between Mac and PC.

48. **External drives** can be formatted for both systems using exFAT.

49. **Time Machine** backups require HFS+ or APFS.

50. **Windows Backup** supports NTFS and exFAT.

## **Peripheral & Accessory Compatibility**

51. **USB peripherals** generally work on both platforms.

52. **Thunderbolt devices** work cross-platform with drivers.

53. **Bluetooth devices** pair with both systems.

54. **Printers** often have drivers for both macOS and Windows.

55. **Scanners** may require manufacturer-specific drivers for macOS.

56. **External GPUs** require OS support to function.

57. **Webcams** are plug-and-play on both systems.

58. **Docking stations** work with both but may have Mac-specific firmware.

59. **Game controllers** often require configuration for macOS.

60. **Specialized hardware** (e.g., PCIe cards) may be Windows-only due to driver availability.
