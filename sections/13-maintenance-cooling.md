## **Cooling Methods**

11. **Air cooling** is the most common method in PCs.

12. **Liquid cooling** transfers heat via coolant loops.

13. **Passive cooling** uses heatsinks without fans.

14. **Active cooling** uses fans or pumps to move air or liquid.

15. **Heat pipes** transfer heat from hot to cool areas.

16. **Thermal pads** fill gaps between heatsinks and components.

17. **Liquid metal thermal compound** offers superior heat transfer.

18. **Hybrid cooling** combines air and liquid methods.

19. **Phase-change cooling** uses refrigerant for extreme cooling.

20. **Immersion cooling** submerges hardware in dielectric fluid.

## **Fan Types**

21. **Case fans** move air through the chassis.

22. **CPU fans** attach directly to heatsinks.

23. **GPU fans** cool graphics processors.

24. **Power supply fans** exhaust PSU heat.

25. **Server fans** are high-speed for dense racks.

26. **Blower-style GPU fans** exhaust air out of the case.

27. **Axial fans** push large volumes of air at low pressure.

28. **Centrifugal fans** create high pressure for focused airflow.

29. **PWM fans** adjust speed dynamically.

30. **Static pressure fans** push air through dense heatsinks or radiators.

## **Environmental Controls**

31. **Temperature monitoring** ensures safe operating conditions.

32. **Humidity control** prevents condensation and static buildup.

33. **Air filtration** reduces dust inside systems.

34. **Positive air pressure** reduces dust intake.

35. **Negative air pressure** increases airflow but draws in dust.

36. **Data center HVAC** maintains optimal environment.

37. **Raised floors** improve airflow in server rooms.

38. **Hot aisle/cold aisle** layout improves cooling efficiency.

39. **Rack blanking panels** maintain airflow direction.

40. **Environmental sensors** trigger alerts for unsafe conditions.
