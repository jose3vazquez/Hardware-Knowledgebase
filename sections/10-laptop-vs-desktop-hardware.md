## **Form Factor & Design**

1. **Laptops** are portable, integrating all components in one chassis.

2. **Desktops** have separate towers or cases with more internal space.

3. **Laptop motherboards** are custom-designed for compact layouts.

4. **Desktop motherboards** follow standardized ATX/microATX/mini-ITX formats.

5. **Laptops** prioritize lightweight and thin designs.

6. **Desktops** prioritize expandability and cooling.

7. **Ultrabooks** are ultra-thin laptops with limited ports.

8. **Gaming desktops** can accommodate large GPUs and cooling systems.

9. **Convertible laptops** can switch between laptop and tablet mode.

10. **Small form factor desktops** (SFF) save space but limit upgrades.

## **RAM & Storage**

21. **Laptop RAM** uses SO-DIMM modules.

22. **Desktop RAM** uses full-size DIMMs.

23. **Laptop RAM** may be soldered and non-replaceable.

24. **Desktop RAM** is almost always replaceable and upgradable.

25. **Laptops** often use M.2 NVMe SSDs for space savings.

26. **Desktops** can use larger 3.5" HDDs for capacity.

27. **Laptop storage upgrades** may be limited to one drive bay.

28. **Desktop storage** can include multiple drives in RAID.

29. **Some laptops** support microSD expansion.

30. **Desktops** rely on internal storage and external drives for expansion.

## **Cooling Systems**

31. **Laptop cooling** uses small fans and heat pipes.

32. **Desktop cooling** uses larger fans, heatsinks, and liquid cooling options.

33. **Dust buildup** impacts both, but laptops are harder to clean.

34. **Laptops** may use shared heat pipes for CPU and GPU.

35. **Desktops** have separate cooling for each component.

36. **Laptops** require precise fan curve control for noise and heat.

37. **Desktops** allow larger, quieter cooling solutions.

38. **Overheating** affects laptops more quickly.

39. **Thermal paste replacement** is easier on desktops.

40. **Aftermarket cooling upgrades** are common in desktops.

## **Ports & Connectivity**

41. **Laptops** may sacrifice ports for thinness.

42. **Desktops** offer more USB, display, and network ports.

43. **Laptops** increasingly use USB-C/Thunderbolt for multiple functions.

44. **Desktops** use dedicated ports for each function.

45. **Docking stations** can expand laptop connectivity.

46. **Desktops** use PCIe cards to add functionality.

47. **Laptops** may have built-in webcams and microphones.

48. **Desktops** require external peripherals for audio/video capture.

49. **Laptops** use internal Wi-Fi cards.

50. **Desktops** can upgrade networking via PCIe or USB adapters.

## **Maintenance & Upgradability**

51. **Laptop repairs** often require complete disassembly.

52. **Desktop repairs** allow easy access to components.

53. **Laptop parts** may be proprietary and costly.

54. **Desktop parts** are more standardized and widely available.

55. **Laptop keyboards** are integrated into the chassis.

56. **Desktop keyboards** are external and easily replaced.

57. **Laptop screens** are built into the unit.

58. **Desktop monitors** are separate and swappable.

59. **Laptops** have smaller batteries with limited replacement options.

60. **Desktops** rely on external UPS or surge protection for backup power.
