## **CPU (Central Processing Unit) Basics**

1. **Clock speed** is measured in GHz and determines how many cycles per second a CPU can execute.

2. **Core count** represents independent processing units within the CPU.

3. **Threads** allow multiple processes per core using technologies like Intel Hyper-Threading.

4. **Instruction set architecture (ISA)** defines supported commands (x86, x64, ARM).

5. **Cache memory** (L1, L2, L3) stores frequently used instructions close to the CPU.

6. **TDP (Thermal Design Power)** measures expected heat output in watts.

7. **Base clock vs. boost clock** ‚Äî boost temporarily increases performance.

8. **Integrated memory controller** manages communication with RAM.

9. **Pipelining** breaks instructions into stages for faster execution.

10. **Branch prediction** reduces delays by guessing instruction flow.
