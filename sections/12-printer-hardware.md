## **Printer Types**

1. **Laser printers** use toner powder and a fuser assembly.

2. **Inkjet printers** spray liquid ink through nozzles.

3. **Thermal printers** use heat-sensitive paper.

4. **Impact printers** physically strike an ink ribbon (e.g., dot matrix).

5. **Multifunction printers (MFPs)** combine printing, scanning, copying, and faxing.

6. **Plotters** create large-format line drawings.

7. **3D printers** build objects layer-by-layer from filament or resin.

8. **Dye-sublimation printers** use heat to transfer dye onto media.

9. **Label printers** print adhesive-backed labels.

10. **Receipt printers** are often thermal-based for retail.

## **Laser Printer Components**

11. **Imaging drum** holds the electrostatic image.

12. **Primary corona wire** charges the drum before imaging.

13. **Laser scanning assembly** writes the image onto the drum.

14. **Developer unit** applies toner to the drum.

15. **Transfer belt/roller** moves toner from drum to paper.

16. **Fuser assembly** melts toner into paper fibers.

17. **Toner cartridge** contains toner powder and sometimes the drum.

18. **Waste toner bottle** collects excess toner.

19. **Pickup rollers** feed paper into the printer.

20. **Separation pads** prevent multiple pages from feeding at once.
