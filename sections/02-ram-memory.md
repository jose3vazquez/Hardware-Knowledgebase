## **RAM Types & Form Factors**

1. **DDR (Double Data Rate)** RAM transfers data on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal.

2. **DDR2** is faster than DDR but uses lower voltage.

3. **DDR3** improves bandwidth and reduces voltage further.

4. **DDR4** increases speed and efficiency, commonly found in modern systems.

5. **DDR5** doubles bandwidth compared to DDR4 and supports higher capacities.

6. **SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)** synchronizes with the system clock.

7. **SO-DIMM** (Small Outline DIMM) modules are used in laptops and compact PCs.

8. **MicroDIMM** is an even smaller module for ultraportable devices.

9. **ECC (Error-Correcting Code) RAM** detects and corrects single-bit memory errors.

10. **Registered (Buffered) RAM** includes a register to improve signal integrity in servers.

## **Speeds, Latency & Channels**

11. **Memory Speed** is measured in MT/s (megatransfers per second) or MHz.

12. **CAS Latency (CL)** measures the delay between a command and data availability.

13. **Dual-channel** memory doubles data path width for better performance.

14. **Triple-channel** memory provides even greater bandwidth in supported systems.

15. **Quad-channel** memory is common in high-end workstations and servers.

16. **Unbuffered RAM** is standard in desktops and laptops.

17. **Parity RAM** detects (but doesnâ€™t correct) memory errors.

18. **Overclocked RAM** runs at speeds above official specifications for higher performance.

19. **XMP Profiles** (Intel Extreme Memory Profile) simplify overclocking setups.

20. **AMP Profiles** (AMD Memory Profile) serve a similar purpose for AMD systems.

## **Installation & Compatibility**

21. **Key Notches** in RAM prevent incorrect installation.

22. **Voltage Requirements** differ by RAM generation (e.g., DDR4 \= 1.2V).

23. **Motherboard Support** determines maximum RAM type, speed, and capacity.

24. **CPU Memory Controller** limits the total and speed of supported RAM.

25. **Mixing Different Speeds** results in all RAM running at the slowest speed.

26. **Mixing Different Capacities** is possible but may disable multi-channel mode.

27. **Static Precautions** must be observed when handling RAM modules.

28. **Firm Insertion** is required until side latches click into place.

29. **BIOS/UEFI Detection** confirms installed RAM quantity and speed.

30. **Memory Diagnostics** tools (e.g., Windows Memory Diagnostic) check for defects.

## **Advanced Memory Technologies**

31. **LPDDR (Low Power DDR)** is used in mobile devices for efficiency.

32. **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)** stacks memory chips for extreme bandwidth.

33. **GDDR** (Graphics DDR) is optimized for GPUs.

34. **VRAM** stores graphics data for display output.

35. **SGRAM (Synchronous Graphics RAM)** is used in some video cards.

36. **Persistent Memory Modules** retain data after power loss.

37. **NVDIMM** combines DRAM with NAND flash for non-volatility.

38. **Optane Memory** acts as a caching layer for storage.

39. **Page Mode DRAM** is an older type used in legacy systems.

40. **EDO RAM** (Extended Data Out) was common before SDRAM.

## **Server & Enterprise Memory**

41. **ECC Registered RAM** is standard in mission-critical servers.

42. **Hot-Pluggable Memory** can be added or removed without powering down in some enterprise systems.

43. **Memory RAS Features** improve reliability, availability, and serviceability.

44. **Lockstep Memory Mode** pairs DIMMs for advanced error correction.

45. **Sparing Mode** sets aside memory modules as automatic replacements.

46. **Mirroring Mode** duplicates all memory contents for fault tolerance.

47. **Rank** refers to a set of DRAM chips accessed simultaneously.

48. **Memory Interleaving** improves performance by alternating access between banks.

49. **NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)** optimizes access in multi-CPU systems.

50. **DIMM Thermal Sensors** help monitor operating temperatures.

## **Maintenance & Troubleshooting**

51. **Dust-Free Slots** are important to ensure proper electrical contact.

52. **Memtest86** is a common tool for testing memory stability.

53. **Faulty RAM** can cause random crashes and blue screens.

54. **Thermal Throttling** can occur if RAM overheats.

55. **Static Discharge Damage** can cause latent or immediate failure.

56. **Oxidation on Contacts** can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol.

57. **Underclocking RAM** may stabilize unstable systems.

58. **Reseating Modules** can resolve poor contact issues.

59. **Memory Timings** can be adjusted in BIOS for tuning.

60. **Upgrade Planning** should match RAM type, speed, and voltage for compatibility.
