## ✅ Exam Domains Covered  

This repository focuses on the CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) exam content most relevant to hardware and infrastructure. It emphasizes:
- PC components and peripherals
- Storage, memory, and processor technologies
- Cabling and connectivity standards
- Device installation and configuration
- Hardware and network troubleshooting practices

Together, these topics form the hardware foundation required for A+ Core 1. 

*The remaining domains — OS, security, operational procedures, cloud — are covered in the **CompTIA A+ Knowledge Base (Continued)**.*
